IT Support Engineer. I live in Glasgow, Scotland and also work in Glasgow.

Have been working in IT for 5 years. Started off in a small IT repair company and now working for a company supporting schools within the UK.

Started my Powershell journey in 2014\. I watched the excellent videos over in Microsoft Virtual Academy with Jeffery Snover and Jason Helmick

A great way to start if you have not already.

My claim to fame so far is the great Jeffery Snover has like one of my tweets. Yes I am a fan boy.

You can find me in https://powershell.org usually helping with PowerShell queries as best I can, occasionally posting my own issues.

If you want to ask me anything, please get me in Twitter.
