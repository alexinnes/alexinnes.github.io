When having to search for a user in Office 365 and you manage multiple tenancies. It can become a time consuming take.
<!--more-->
As you have to find the TenantID which will then allow you to search for a user in that tenant.

So I wrote myself a small function that if you input the User Principle name it split the name into username and domain name.
It then takes the domain name and searches for the tenant contract that matches that domain name and will use the tenant ID against that contract to search for the user.

Nothing groundbreaking but just something that helps me day to day.

This is probably my most used script as it saves me bucket loads of time
