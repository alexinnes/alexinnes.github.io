Hello,

First let me give you a run down of who I am and why I am writing this.

I am Alex Innes, IT Support Engineer. I live in Glasgow, Scotland and also work in Glasgow.
<--!more-->
As many IT Pros I have a great love for PowerShell learning and sharing my knowledge. Which is the main reason
I am writing this blog. 

The main focus of this blog will be my experiences with PowerShell and my learning outcomes, hopefully written in a way that will provide some help
to someone else down the line.

There might be more than just PowerShell in the blog too, anything in the IT world that grabs my attention might get posted up too. If I manage to 
play with it or work with it - Nano Server comes to mind.

So, if interested, watch this space.
